## General Guidelines

### Tools & AI Usage

**Use whatever tools you normally use** - including AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, or Cursor. We want to see how you work in a real environment.

Please document your AI usage in the `AI_USAGE.md` file:
- What prompts worked well?
- What did you accept, modify, or reject?
- What issues did you catch in AI-generated code?

### What We're Looking For

- **Correctness** - Does it work and handle edge cases?
- **Code quality** - Is it readable and maintainable?
- **Testing** - Are important scenarios covered?
- **Documentation** - Can we understand your approach?
- **Judgment** - Did you make sensible tradeoffs?

### Time Management

Please respect the time limits. We value your time and want to see what you can accomplish in a realistic timeframe. A working simple solution beats an incomplete complex one.
